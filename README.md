# Quizlet_Match_Hack

Enter a quizlet match game and paste the code in quizlet_match.js in the console. If the popup that says start game does not appear the program will try to click it and return an error. This code will automatically get you 0.5 seconds, modify the 500 to whatever you want to adjust your time.
